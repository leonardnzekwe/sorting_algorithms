## Algorithmns Implemented

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort (Both Lomuto & Hoares Partitioning Scheme)

## Tasks

- [x]  **Task 0:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
- [x]  **Task 1:** Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
- [x]  **Task 2:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
- [x]  **Task 3:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm (Lomuto partition scheme)
- [ ]  **Task 4:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence
- [ ]  **Task 5:** Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm
- [ ]  **Task 6:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm
- [ ]  **Task 7:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge sort algorithm
- [ ]  **Task 8:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm
- [ ]  **Task 9:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm
- [ ]  **Task 10:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm
- [x]  **Task 11:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm (Hoare partition scheme)
- [ ]  **Task 12:** Write a function that sorts a deck of cards.

## Files

- The File naming convention is based on the name of function it contains and its purpose

## Limitations

- We are yet to implement the `Shell sort (using Knuth sequence)`, `Cocktail shaker sort`, `Counting sort`, `Merge sort`, `Heap sort`, `Radix Sort`, `Bitonic Sort` and the program that `sorts a deck of card`.
